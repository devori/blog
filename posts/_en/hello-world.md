# Hello!

Welcome to my blog built with Next.js.
This is a place to write down what I learn while building things — plus a few thoughts from everyday life.

## Why start a blog?

In software, you keep running into the same problems.
You search, you fix, and then you forget.
If you leave a record, you can find it again later — and it can help someone else too.

> Writing is one of the best ways to organize your thoughts.

## Tech stack

This blog is built with:

- **Next.js** — a full-stack React framework
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first styling
- **Markdown** — for writing content

Code blocks are supported too:

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

## What’s next

I’ll write about a range of topics — mostly web development, TypeScript, and productivity.

Thanks for reading.
